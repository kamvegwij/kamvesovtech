# Software Development Assignment
- The task given is to create a portfolio page using a React framework and deploy using any static site hosting.
# What framework did I choose?
- I chose nextjs as my framework because as someone that enjoys learning new technologies, nextjs' fast rise in the world made me consider this as the first option.
- The fairly large community and ease of development is also a pro in my opinion that makes this a great framework to learn.
# How to bootstrap the project
